# pyenf_dnn
Python based tools to train ENF spectrogram based Neural Network Model

# Environments

Python Version Tested = 3.6.13
Environments used are mentioned in requirements.txt 

## Currently Testing 

Python = 3.9 is currently being tested with the libraries updated to their current version. 

- In the previous version 3.6.13, the scipy library usage was restricted to <= 1.2.0 since the function 'imresize' was used to resize array dimensions.
- The dependency is removed by replacing the function with Pillow library based resize function. 
- The updated pyenf module works for audio recordings. The video recordings are still being tested.
